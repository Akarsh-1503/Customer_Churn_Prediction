# Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective

Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. This project will follow a typical machine learning project pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## Data

You are provided with a dataset containing historical customer information, including customer attributes, interactions, and whether they churned or not. The dataset is in CSV format.

## Tasks

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the provided dataset and perform initial data exploration.
   - Handle missing data and outliers.
   - Prepare the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or neural networks).
   - Train and validate the selected model on the training dataset.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
